# FIX Orchestra Technical Specification
This project contains specifications for FIX Orchestra and FIX Repository 2016 Edition. Additional resources and sample
code is available in project [fix-orchestra](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra).

The purpose of FIX Orchestra is to support the exchange of machine readable rules of engagement between FIX counterparties.

## Versions

The planned lifecycle of this project is to roll out new features in a series of release candidates. After each release candidate is approved, it will be exposed to public review. Issues may be entered here in GitHub or in a discussion forum on the [FIX Trading Community site](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/). When version 1.0 is considered complete, the last release candidate will be promoted to Draft Standard.

### Approved version: 1.0 Release Candidate 1
Version 1.0 RC1 standardizes the XML schema for FIX Orchestra and FIX Repository 2016 Edition. Release Candidate 1 was approved by the Global Technical Committee on Dec. 15, 2016 for 90 day public review.

### Working version: 1.0 Release Candidate 2
The FIX Orchestra working group will consider issues and pull requests for the next release candidate. The planned themes for Release Candidate 2 are:
* Completion of a DSL grammar for conditional expressions
* FIXatdl integration
* Session configuration
