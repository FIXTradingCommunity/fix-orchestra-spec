# FIX Orchestra Technical Specification

This project contains specifications for FIX Orchestra version 1.0. The purpose of FIX Orchestra is to support the exchange of machine readable rules of engagement between FIX counterparties.

Additional resources and sample code is available in project [fix-orchestra](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra).

### Planned Lifecycle

The planned lifecycle of this project is to roll out new features in a series of release candidates. After each release candidate is approved, it will be exposed to public review.  When a version is considered complete, the last release candidate will be promoted to Draft Standard. A Draft Standard may be promoted to final Technical Standard when at least two interoperable implementations are demonstrated.

### Participation

Issues may be entered here in GitHub or in a discussion forum on the [FIX Trading Community site](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/). In GitHub, anyone may enter issues or pull requests for the next release candidate.

## Standards Versions

### Version 1.1 Release Candidate 2
Version 1.1 RC2 is currently work in progress. The work is managed by the [Orchestra Subcommittee](https://www.fixtrading.org/groups/fixorchestra/) of the FIX Trading Community.

### Version 1.1 Release Candidate 1
Version 1.1 RC1 has been completed on November 15, 2023 and [published](https://forum.fixtrading.org/t/public-comment-period-orchestra-version-1-1-rc1/17408). The 90-day public comment period ends on February 16, 2024.

Release Candidates and Beta Versions (previously called Draft Standards) no longer use their own folders. Instead, there is only one folder per minor version of FIX Orchestra and GitHub tags will be used to identify them. Public review comments continue to be applied to the next Release Candidate or Beta Version, i.e. do not require to make changes to the previous Release Candidate.
